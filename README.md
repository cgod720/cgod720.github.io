## The Great Houses of Westeros

### About the App:
This application lists the main houses in Westeros, the country in which Game of Thrones takes place. The houses are all clickable buttons that will list information upon being clicked. They all name the name of the house and which territory they originate from. They also list the current lord of the house and underneath most of them it lists the house "words" or motto. Underneath that, a list of all of the sworn members of the house populates the page upon clicking the particular house button.

### Tech Used:
API: anapioficeandfire.com. 
HTML was used for layout and structure. 
CSS added page styling. 
JQuery was used to retrieve information from API and populate page. 
JavaScript gave the page functionality, and with the help of JQuery, individual themes were given to each house.

###### Problems and Bugs
Only real problem is on mobile. Page is responsive in browser resizing but non-responsive in mobile.
